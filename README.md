# LCD-Neopixel
A intro code for the Adafruit Feather TFT ESP32-S3 board

From the adafruit base build that comes with the board: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/main/Factory_Tests/Feather_ESP32S3_TFT_FactoryTest/Feather_ESP32S3_TFT_FactoryTest.ino

Goals:
 - Change the neopixel using a color cycling function (Wheel)
 - Have the display update with the current value of the color variable, j
 - have the libs deps for the feather to have the neopixel and tft screen ready
 - (Incomplete) Show the current power usage of the ESP32 chip - need to research how to pull this

This was done in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extensions.   The project was created for the Adafruit Feather TFT ESP32-S3.
